There are 108 MSSU across Punjab and 26 Units in Lahore. The current manual process of financial assistance allocation and fund management for Medical Social Services Projects (MSSP) and Patient Welfare Society (PWS) in Punjab lacks automation, leading to potential inefficiencies, delays, and errors in fund allocation, patient registration, verification and donation management, which hinders effective support to needy patients in a timely and transparent manner.
