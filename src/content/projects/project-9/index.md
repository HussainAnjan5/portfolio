WEPX 2025, in collaboration with the Women Development Department Punjab, is a landmark event dedicated to advancing gender equality and empowering women across Punjab. Inspired by WDDâ€™s mission, the expo brings together women from all walks of life to engage in transformative workshops, policy discussions, and skill-building sessions.

Our goal is to foster economic empowerment, promote inclusive development, and provide platforms for women to lead and innovate. Join us to explore initiatives like the Punjab Women Protection Authority, vocational training programs, and advocacy for gender mainstreaming.
