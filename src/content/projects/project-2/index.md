## Introduction
The AJ&K PSC Recruitment System is an official mobile application developed by the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) for the Azad Jammu & Kashmir Public Service Commission (AJ&K PSC). This app streamlines the entire recruitment lifecycle with a user-friendly interface for candidates applying to government jobs in AJ&K. All necessary actions may be performed through smart App. 
As the Province’s technology spearhead, PITB is responsible for maintaining the foundational IT infrastructure and system of Punjab i.e. a data center for hosting along with managing official email identities. Our organization has provided systems and solutions that have positively impacted the Jobs portal, Health, Education and Law & Order sectors of the province. Moreover, PITB’s immense efforts towards better and transparent mobile governance reforms have been acknowledged globally as well, for instance recently the World Bank’s President appreciated our mobile governance reforms at the World Bank’s Daylight Dialogue’ 2014 in Philippines. Additionally, PITB is striving to promote entrepreneurship culture in the country along with capacity building of both professionals (public and private sector) and students from across Pakistan.
PITB has laudably achieved success and has effectively worked towards the aims and objectives under which it was formed.
