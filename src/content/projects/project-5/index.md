<b>Collective Marriages Programme by CM Punjab</b>

Maryam Nawaz Sharif, CM Punjab has approved the Punjab Dhee Rani Programme (Collective Marriages Programme). This programme aims to enable deserving parents to fulfill their socio-religious obligation in a dignified manner. Marriage is considered as a sacred social contract in Islam which forms the basis of stable and happy family life. The current economic situation of the country and financial constraints prevents many underprivileged parents from performing this obligation for their children. The collective marriages Programme will create a positive impact by fostering a sense of Governmentâ€™s ownership, hope, and stability in society.
